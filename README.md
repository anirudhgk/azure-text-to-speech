## About:

In this application we convert text into humanlike synthesized speech using NodeJS â€“ Express. It best allows to provide the audio without the cost of manually generating the audio.

-	[Visual_Studio_Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) - installed to your local machine.
-	[Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) - installed to your local machine.
-	Use [Azure_Cloud_Shell](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-shell/quickstart) using the bash to create Speech resource.
(This will require you to authenticate in a browser with your account and with a valid azure subscription)
